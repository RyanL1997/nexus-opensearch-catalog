### All 3 integrations

- Remove the appending wording "Aggregated Version" for each visualizations

### Found in WAF

- Add 5 rows of data for WAF, with `BLOCK` status, however, found an issue that when I manually refresh the MV, it will double the count in visualization. So it seems like when there is new data coming in, if the index is being refreshed, there is not mechanism for it to know, what are the new data, so that the current query will fetch through the dataset again and record/group by everything again.
- Add a deduplication key based on unique identifiers (like @timestamp or a combination of key fields) to ensure each entry is processed only once. This is particularly useful if the data source includes a unique identifier for each row.
- According to the above, try the following for WAF integration:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW aws_waf_agg_mv_select_distinct_0
AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  TUMBLE(`@timestamp`, '5 Minute').start AS `start_time`,
  webaclId AS `aws.waf.webaclId`,
  action AS `aws.waf.action`,
  `httpRequest.clientIp` AS `aws.waf.httpRequest.clientIp`,
  `httpRequest.country` AS `aws.waf.httpRequest.country`,
  `httpRequest.uri` AS `aws.waf.httpRequest.uri`,
  `httpRequest.httpMethod` AS `aws.waf.httpRequest.httpMethod`,
  httpSourceId AS `aws.waf.httpSourceId`,
  terminatingRuleId AS `aws.waf.terminatingRuleId`,
  terminatingRuleType AS `aws.waf.RuleType`,
  `ruleGroupList.ruleId` AS `aws.waf.ruleGroupList.ruleId`,
  COUNT(*) AS `aws.waf.event_count`
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    CAST(FROM_UNIXTIME(`timestamp` / 1000) AS TIMESTAMP) AS `@timestamp`,
    webaclId,
    action,
    httpRequest.clientIp AS `httpRequest.clientIp`,
    httpRequest.country AS `httpRequest.country`,
    httpRequest.uri AS `httpRequest.uri`,
    httpRequest.httpMethod AS `httpRequest.httpMethod`,
    httpSourceId,
    terminatingRuleId,
    terminatingRuleType,
    ruleGroupList.ruleId AS `ruleGroupList.ruleId`
  FROM
    aws_waf_100_oct24
)
GROUP BY
  TUMBLE(`@timestamp`, '5 Minute'),
  webaclId,
  action,
  `httpRequest.clientIp`,
  `httpRequest.country`,
  `httpRequest.uri`,
  `httpRequest.httpMethod`,
  httpSourceId,
  terminatingRuleId,
  terminatingRuleType,
  `ruleGroupList.ruleId`
```

- Once the above MV gets created, we do the initial refresh to pop the data in: `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW aws_waf_agg_mv_select_distinct_0`
- Once the above refresh is done, in dev tool, search the following for getting the total event count:

```
GET flint_flinttest1_default_aws_waf_agg_mv_select_distinct_0/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "1": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "aws.waf.event_count"
      }
    }
  },
  "size": 0,
  "stored_fields": [
    "*"
  ],
  "script_fields": {},
  "docvalue_fields": [
    {
      "field": "start_time",
      "format": "date_time"
    }
  ],
  "_source": {
    "excludes": []
  },
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [],
      "filter": [
        {
          "match_all": {}
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "start_time": {
              "gte": "2009-10-30T02:30:30.306Z",
              "lte": "2024-10-30T02:30:30.306Z",
              "format": "strict_date_optional_time"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [],
      "must_not": []
    }
  }
}
```

and then we are getting

```
{
  "took": 827,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 22,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "1": {
      "value": 105
    }
  }
}
```

Which is the expected result - 100 rows + 5 rows with `BLOCK` status I added earlier today

- However, lets refresh the index again: `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW aws_waf_agg_mv_select_distinct_0`, and re-run the above dql query in dev tool:

```
{
  "took": 905,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 44,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "1": {
      "value": 210
    }
  }
}
```

Which shows the value gets doubled to 210 which means the `SELECT DISTINCT` doesn't work.
