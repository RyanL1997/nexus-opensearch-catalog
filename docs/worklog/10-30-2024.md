### Deduplication issue found for manual refresh

- It seems only existing on manual refresh index since there is no checkpoint to record the dedup key.
- There was a PR in `opensearch-spark` related to this: [Exactly-once guarantee for covering index and MV incremental refresh #143
](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-spark/pull/143)
- So no actionable items for now since this is a known behavior

### CloudTrail

- Add 3 fields for the filter panel: "Event Category", "Account ID", and "Services". Update the latest dashboard ndjson: `amazon-cloudtail-log.ndjson`
