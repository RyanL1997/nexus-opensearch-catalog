### VPC

- Demo for VPC Integration Dashboards
  - Setup with 10,000 rows of data from test account's log group
  - MV is created by the following aggregated query

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW vpc_mv_10000_100424_agg
AS
  SELECT
    TUMBLE(`@timestamp`, '1 Minute').start AS `start_time`,
    action AS `aws.vpc.action`,
    srcAddr AS `aws.vpc.srcaddr`,
    dstAddr AS `aws.vpc.dstaddr`,
    COUNT(*) AS `aws.vpc.total_count`,
    SUM(bytes) AS `aws.vpc.total_bytes`,
    SUM(packets) AS `aws.vpc.total_packets`
  FROM (
    SELECT
      action,
      srcAddr,
      dstAddr,
      bytes,
      packets,
      CAST(FROM_UNIXTIME(start) AS TIMESTAMP) AS `@timestamp`
    FROM
      aws_vpc_loggroup10000rows
  )
GROUP BY
  TUMBLE(`@timestamp`, '1 Minute'),
  action,
  srcAddr,
  dstAddr
-- WITH (
--   auto_refresh = true,
--   refresh_interval = '15 Minute',
--   watermark_delay = '1 Minute',
--   checkpoint_location = '{checkpoint_location}'
-- )
```

- Compare to the original VPC dashboards, we just dropped the visualization of `Filters` and `Raw search table` panels.
